# Types of Version Control System(VCS):
    1. local VCS
    2. centralised VCS
    3. distributed VCS

# github, gitlab, bitbucket --- hosting service providers which host git repos and provide GUI. Git is free but these may charge

# git - distributed VCS
      - started by linus trovalds in 2005 
      - stores all snapshot of each changes which enables us to obtain the any snapshot at anytime and also takes less disk as it stores only changes not whole file

# intializing folder as git repo

    git init                               
    
# just created branch can be renamed by ; by default created branch is master during initialization

    git branch -m <branchname> 

# intial setup

#  three stage architecture

    WD - local files and folder in the computer where we are working

    staging area - files and folder ready for commit


# to track or add files in staging area

    git add --a     or      git add .        or git add -a


# to commit added files

    git commit -m "initial commit"

# to skip staging area

    git commit -a -m "initial commit"

# to see commits 

    git log 

# diff in commits 

    git log -p                   --- all
    
    git log -p -2                --- last 2 lines

# customized commit output

    git log --pretty=short

    git log --pretty=full

    git log --pretty=format:"%h --an"              --- author name and hash

    git log --since=2.weeks

# ignoring files in git

# types of branches 

    1. long running branches - e.g., master , development
    2. topic branches - short lived branches , made for to tackle particular topic

# delete  branch from remote 

    git push -d origin <branchname>

# change last commit message

    git commit --amend

# change address of existing url 

    git remote set-url origin <new-url>

# delete git repo

    rm -rf .git (in linux)

# merges histories of two projects that started their lives independently

    git pull --allow-unrelated-histories

# created new branch on local which is not existed on cloud and pushing it for the first time

    git push --set-upstream origin tempo
